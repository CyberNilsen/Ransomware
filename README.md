## ⚠️ EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY ⚠️

This software is designed **ONLY** for educational purposes to understand:
- Encryption/decryption mechanisms
- Python programming concepts
- GUI development with Tkinter
- Cybersecurity threats and protections

**NEVER** use this code for malicious purposes. Unauthorized encryption of files is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- **File Encryption/Decryption**: Simulates how ransomware encrypts and decrypts files
- **Interactive GUI**: Recreates the look and feel of ransomware interfaces
- **Safe Environment**: Includes built-in protection mechanisms (predefined password)
- **Educational Comments**: Code is thoroughly commented to explain functionality

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Image processing
- **Cryptography**: Fernet symmetric encryption
- **Hashlib**: Password hashing

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
bash
```
git clone https://github.com/username/RansomwareSimulator.git
